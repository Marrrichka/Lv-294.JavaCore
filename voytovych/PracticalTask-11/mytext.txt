William Shakespeare's sonnets are stories about a handsome boy,
or rival poet, and the mysterious and aloof "dark" lady they 
both love. The sonnets fall into three clear groupings: 
Sonnets 1 to 126 are addressed to, or concern, a young man; var
Sonnets 127-152 are addressed to, or concern, a dark lady 
(dark in the sense of her hair, her facial features, and her character), 
and Sonnets 153-154 are fairly free adaptations of two classical Greek poems. var
